# Spam-Mail-Prediction

This project aims to build a Machine Learning model which aims to detect whether a mail is a Spam mail or a Ham Mail.
The idea behind this is to put all the mails into a spam folder sent by spammers which unnecessarily clutters the inbox and in turn miss out on the important mails, implemented using Machine Learning Algorithm, Logistic Regression, which determines the accuracy of prediction up to 3 decimal places
